# Contributing

XXX Needs instructions how how to get up and running to do dev,
linting and testing.


## Style guide

All patches are expected to run [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
as described and configured in the `package.json`'s `lint-staged` script.
I.e. single quotes and no semicolons.

Variables names should be camelCase and it's `someUrl` or `someCss` not
`someURL` or `someCSS`.
